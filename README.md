MLND-Capstone
My project is a simple Credit Card Approval Prediction using Machine Learning. 
It implements Binary Classification using LinearLearner in AWS SageMaker environment.
My capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. The folder includes my initial project proposal, my final project report, the csv file used, and the final project ipynb(jupyter notebook) file.
It also includes a directory called CreditCardApproval which contains 4 file. Two of them are rough files and not meant to be used. The other two are test.csv and train.csv which are the final files I upload on S3 after all the pre-processing.
No as such special environment/library is required for the implementation of this project.
